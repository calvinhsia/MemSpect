Could not init comm Minidumpfile=D:\MemSpect\Dumps\MemoryDumpfromOomCrash.dmp 
MemSpect.exe is the UI part of the MemSpect tool http://calvinh6/MemSpect
If 1st param is "/"
    "m" means the 2nd param is the path to a Minidump (like a Watson dump)
            Example: MemSpect /m mydump.dmp
            if 2nd param is omitted, will OpenFileDialog
    "o" means the 2nd param is the path to a MegaSnapshot offline dump. 
            Example: MemSpect /o MemSpectDump0
        if 2nd param is omitted, will BrowseforFolder

    "p" means browse for process to which to attach (it must have been started with the memspect env vars)

    "c" means create an offline snapshot using a process id and output folder
            Example: MemSpect /c 1234 c:\OfflineSnapshot
        Parameters can be specified in any order or skipped.  Any skipped parameters will display UI to obtain them.


Else
    1st param is the integer PID of the process that was started under Memspect
