;
; When an immersive manifest is used to start MemSpect (from ProcA: MemSpect.exe)
;	1. The MEMSPECT_MANIFEST_PATH path is written to the INI file in the MemSpect Installdir
;	2. Some MemSpect files are copied to the PackagePath so that they are accessible to the lowbox process
;	3. IPackageDebugSettings::EnableDebugging is called, with the "Debugger cmdline" parameter "c:\MemSpect\MemSpect.Exe". (or whatever your MemSpect.exe path is)
;				This setting persists for the package until DisableDebugging is called (meaning starting the app manually will invoke the "debugger")
;	4. The Package is Activated (Launched ProcJ) in a Suspended state and the 
;						"Debugger" process is started (MemSpect.exe ProcDbg) with the parameters "c:\MemSpect\MemSpect.Exe -pid 1234 -tid 5678" (or whatever your MemSpect.exe path is)
;	5. The "Debugger"
;		a. writes the thread id to the INI file in the package folder (ImmersiveTID) (you can verify manually)
;		b. injects c:\Windows\System32\MemSpect\MemSpectdll.dll into the target process (ProcJ), which does normal MemSpect behavior:
;           i. For immersive, you must deploy MemSpectDll.Dll to "C:\Windows\System32\MemSpect\MemSpectDll.Dll" there as an admin, because MemSpect must run as non-admin for Immersive.
;					(note: on 64 bit os, due to redirection, should be "C:\Windows\SysWow64\MemSpect\MemSpectDll.dll"
;                   (you can copy all the MemSpect files there, but it gets confusing if you do: 
;                     MemSpect cannot run as admin to launch Immersive, 
;                      but must run as admin to write to the INI file (Catch 22).  Thus just copy the single MemSpectDll.dll file there)
;			ii. The injected DllMain creates a named pipe, 2 events and shared memory in the lowbox Windows session
;			iii. creates a new thread to listen for events from the MemSpect UI. 
;					This new thread reads the ImmersiveTID and resumes that thread so the app continues to run (doesn't work to resume in DllMain)
;					and the Launch operation completes (started from ProcA and returns control to ProcA)
;		c. the injected thread (in ProcJ) terminates
;		d. The "Debugger" process (ProcDbg) terminates
;	6. ProcA knows the PID and Attaches to Existing MemSpect launched process
;		a. Tries to connect to the lowbox created named pipes, events, shared mem
;			These connections have to go through the AppContainerNamedObjectPath 

;    (Steps 1 -3 are done when EnableDebug is pressed. Then you can use the OS Start menu to launch if you like. That will inject, then you can attach)
;	This means the PackagePath needs to be made writable: If it's Program Files, change security (take ownership, grant Full access). 
;		If the files aren't copied to the same folder as the Manifest, then its a security problem
;	The files are copied to the package path

;TrackClrObjects = 1 (default 0 (off)) will track ClrObjects thru GC's. Will be slower. Can toggle this through UI too. 
; if the initial value is off, then ClrObjs will not be tracked. Check the ClrObj checkbox to turn it on 
; turning on with chk box midstream just loses callstacks of existing objects at time of turning on. All CLR Objs (new & existing) are still tracked.
; regardless of setting, managed stack frames will be correct.
TrackClrObjects = 1

;TrackGCStacks = 1 (default 1 = on) will track stacks of GCs. Does not require TrackClrObjects to be on.
; Note to Prism users: turn this off because it stores callstacks for all GC Stacks, which are never freed
TrackGCStacks = 1

;TrackJIT = 1(default 0 = off) will track JIT stacks. Read only at startup. Does not require TrackClrObjects to be on.
; Note to Prism users: turn this off because it stores callstacks for all JIT functions, which are never freed
TrackJIT=1;

;TrackExcpt = 1(default 0 = off) will track CLR Exception stacks. Read only at startup. Does not require TrackClrObjects to be on.
; Note to Prism users: turn this off because it stores callstacks for all ClrExceptions, which are never freed
TrackExcpt=1;

;TrackETW = 0 (default 0 = off, 1 = on) will track EventTrace and TraceEvent ETW events.
; Note to Prism users: turn this off because it stores callstacks for all ETW Events, which are never freed
TrackETW = 0

;TrackArenas = 0 (default = 1) will track Arena (No Release) Allocators in a heap called "_Arenas"
; This requires instrumentation (JScript has implemented it, VB has it with Shelveset Arena;calvinh)
; if not instrumented, does nothing.
TrackArenas = 1


;CheckGCLostObjects=0   MemSpect diagnostic: makes GC very slow. Verifies that Memspect tracked CLR objects and GC CLR objects match on each GC.
; if 1, will turn on asserts & track objs (very slow)
; if 2, will output log of GC to c:\gclog.txt (even slower)
CheckGCLostObjects=0



;OutputToDebugWindow will output log info into debug window of attached debugger
OutputToDebugWindow=1

;FreezeAtStartup =0 means do nothing. 1 means non-target process will Freeze targ proc as early as possible
FreezeAtStartup =0

;TrackGhost is read upon initial connection by the MemSpect API (not the inproc part)
;  Normally, by default, the tag (consisting of callstack, SeqNo, Thread) is discarded when memory is freed.
;  Ghost will NOT discard the tag info. Thus you can catch certain kinds of inefficiencies
;  things like high memory users what causes lots of GCs. Turns off autorefresh
;  Toggle on/off around scenario
; All GhostTracks are cleared when UnFreezing.
;   TrackGhost = 1 means track ghost on. Also can be toggled from Menu->Track Ghost
TrackGhost=0


;Offline Snapshot control
; IncludeHeapReport = 1   means include a heap density report in offline snapshot. Takes a lot of memory to calculate. (read at snap time)
IncludeHeapReport = 1

;LeakMultiplePercentThreshold an integer between 0 and 100: the percent of buckets that a stack must occur in to be considered a leak
; When looking for leaks in N buckets, a leak typically would occur in 100% of the buckets. However, due to GC, inconsistent iteration events, 
;  this might be lower. This affects only leakmultiples with explicit pairs. leakMultiples without explicit pairs default to %50.
LeakMultiplePercentThreshold=75

;LeakMultipleIterationTolerance as integer between 0 and 100: the percent of iterations that an occurrence must have in order
; to be considered a leak. 25% tolerance means an item must occur in LeakMultiple +- .25(LeakMultiple) iterations.
; currently ignored!!
LeakMultipleIterationTolerance= 20
 
;EnableAsserts =1 means any internal asserts in Memspect will show. Set to 0 to disable internal asserts
EnableAsserts = 1

; (note:the vshost setting also excludes things like WindowsApplication1.Vshost.exe)
vshost=1

;DllsToAssertOn= semicolon surrounding list of case insensitive JustFileName to assert on so debugger can attach when load encountered, by createfile or mappedfile
; (MAX_PATH limit) Example:
;    DllsToAssertOn = ;grooveNew.dll;csprojui.dll;microsoft.csharp.ni.dll;
